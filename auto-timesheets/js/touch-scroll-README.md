# touchScroll jQuery plugin

## About

touchScroll is a jQuery plugin that provides a way to have inline scrollable content. It mimics the behaviour of scrolling on iOS devices (iPhone, iPod touch and iPad) to solve the problem that `position: fixed;` does not work in mobile Safari.

- This plugin will only work for vertical-scrolling content. It has been designed with only this in mind to keep the library lightweight and efficient.
- The code is based on [iScroll](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll), but is a simpler (and more accurate) plugin for jQuery.

For a more sophisticated scrolling library, I highly recommend [Scrollability](http://joehewitt.github.com/scrollability/), which, although not a jQuery plugin, is a very accurate and capable solution to the same problem.

## Example

Using your iOS device (iPhone, iPod touch or iPad), view an example of touchScroll in action at: [neave.github.com/touch-scroll/example.html](http://neave.github.com/touch-scroll/example.html)

For an example of a page with a fixed footer, view this page on your iOS device: [neave.github.com/touch-scroll/footer.html](http://neave.github.com/touch-scroll/footer.html)

Make sure your code uses the same base CSS as provided in these examples.

## How to use

`$('nav').touchScroll(); // Creates touch-scrollable content for a 'nav' element`

`$('nav').touchScroll({y: 100}); // Change the initial vertical scroll position to 100 pixels down`

`$('nav').touchScroll({scrollHeight: 1000}); // Manually set height of the scrollable area, useful for dynamically sized pages`

`$('nav').touchScroll({elastic: false}); // Turn off the elastic-bounce at the end of a scroll movement`

`$('nav').touchScroll({momentum: false}); // Turn off the momentum when a finger is lifted from the screen`

`$('nav').touchScroll({elastic: false, momentum: false}); // Turn off both elastic-bounce and momentum`

`$('nav').touchScroll({touchTags: ['a']}); // Allow the 'a' tag to receive touch events`

`$('nav').touchScroll('update'); // Refresh the touch-scroll area if content has changed`

`$('nav').touchScroll('setPosition', 100); // Method to set the content vertical scroll position at any time`

`var scrollY = $('nav').touchScroll('getPosition'); // Returns the current vertical scroll position in pixels`
